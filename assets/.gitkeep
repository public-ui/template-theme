# Custom assets folder

This folder contrains custom assets for the template theme and
will be included in the final build package of the theme. To
ensure that the folder is tracked by git, this file is included
as a placeholder.

`package.json` changes to copy assets:

```json
"scripts": {
	"prepare": "cpy \"node_modules/@public-ui/components/assets/**/*\" assets --dot",
  ...other scripts
},
"devDependencies": {
	"cpy-cli": "6.0.0",
  ...other dependencies
}
```



`.gitignore` changes to avoid ignoring the assets folder:

```bash
!assets/kolicons/
!assets/kolibri.ico
```
